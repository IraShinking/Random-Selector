# Random-Selector
My first WeChat mini program acts as a random selector.

I designed and built it by myself for my best friend.

In this mini program, you can add your own lists and select the items in them randomly.

Every user's list will be seperately stored on the Tencent Cloud. So whenever you use this mini program on your wechat, you can see your own lists there. 
I had prepared the default lists for everyone new to this mini program, and also a brief guide.
Hope you all like it.

One of the most wonderful achievement I had in this mini program is that **I combine the techniques built in [westore](https://github.com/Tencent/westore) into my mini program**--you can see how it works remarkable **in the communication between the database on Tencent Cloud and the local data-storage in this mini program**.

Also, it took me some hours to rewrite all those code in a more compact way, so that the mini-program is as small as nearly 300kb(including nearly 200kb icon pictures).

I've learned a lot from this mini program, from a totally new one to a beginner, and I hope it may help anyone else who need some more guidence to grow his or her own production.
